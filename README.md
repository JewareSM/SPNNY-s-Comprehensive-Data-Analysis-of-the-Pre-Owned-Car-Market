In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of Spinnyâ€™s pre-owned car sales data to help increase revenue by boosting the number of completed transactions. Spinny, a leading online used-car retailing platform in India, aimed to optimize its pricing strategies, better manage regional inventory, and enhance customer satisfaction.

The project focused on three main areas:

Demand Analysis: Assessed car demand across different regions and identified high-demand car models and attributes such as fuel type, condition, and mileage.

Price Analysis: Explored price distribution based on key car attributes like condition and transmission, and analyzed price trends across manufacturers and models.

Revenue Analysis: Investigated how factors like car age, condition, odometer reading, title status, and seasonality impact overall revenue generation.
